Connect-Four
============

This is a small project that I created. It is a Javascript implementation of the famous game (Connect Four).
An online live version of this can be found in my website: www.aleisa.me/Connect-Four
Native Javascript code has been used without jQuery or any other library.
For easier readability and maintainability, Javascirpt code has been split into multiple files.

I hope you can benefit from this :)

Yours,
Omar
